### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at Royal Holloway University of London. Building my skillset as a full stack developer.

I have a few public repositories of projects I have worked on. Most of them are Hackathons, so have very little further development post the hackathon. Hoping to add more interesting projects soon.
